Hi!

Given that the complexity of problem is growing will be necessary design a new solution.
I think that the best solution is apply a pattern.
I think that a good pattern to do a well solution is the abstract factory pattern to create products and
the offers linked to these products.

How the premises of the problem are a little bit ambiguous I will change the steps of process:
1 - calculate first the total price without offers
2 - apply the offers

WIRD
THAT CASE:
assertThat(checkout.checkout("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"), equalTo(853));
1: have a combination fo buy any 3 of (S,T,X,Y,Z) but the result is the sum of all elements
BUT
assertThat(checkout.checkout("STX"), equalTo(45));
assertThat(checkout.checkout("STXSTX"), equalTo(90));
this cases the offer have been applied.... ambiguous.. ok...
